    <h1>Old Fashioned Pancakes</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy,
            and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen
            (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).
        </p>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cup milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3> 
           <ol>
                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center
                    and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
                </li>
              
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter
                    onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the 
                    edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side.
                    Repeat with remaining batter.
                </li>
            </ol>
